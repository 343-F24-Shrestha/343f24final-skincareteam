            <h1>Adult Skin Types</h1>
            <p>As adults, our skin undergoes various changes influenced by age, lifestyle, genetics, and environmental
                factors. Recognizing your skin type is essential for developing an effective skincare routine that
                addresses its unique needs. Below, we discuss the main skin types adults may have and the
                characteristics that define them.</p>

            <h3>Normal Skin</h3>
            <p>Normal skin is well-balanced, neither too oily nor too dry, and exhibits minimal imperfections. This skin
                type typically feels smooth and comfortable with a consistent texture. It has a natural glow without
                excessive shine and usually has few visible pores. People with normal skin should still follow a basic
                skincare regimen to maintain its health and prevent premature aging.</p>

            <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
            <p>Dry skin can feel tight, rough, or flaky, with a dull appearance. It may be more prone to fine lines and
                irritation, especially when exposed to harsh weather or dry environments. Adults with dry skin should
                use moisturizers and hydrating products to help lock in moisture and strengthen the skinâ€™s barrier. Look
                for formulations with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin for optimal hydration.
            </p>

            <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
            <p>Oily skin is characterized by excess sebum production, which can lead to a shiny complexion, especially
                in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). While it may be more resilient to wrinkles due to its natural
                oils, oily skin can be prone to acne and blackheads. Cleansers containing salicylic acid or benzoyl
                peroxide can help control oil and reduce breakouts. A non-comedogenic moisturizer is essential to
                prevent clogged pores.</p>

            <h3>Combination Skin</h3>
            <p>Combination skin is a mix of different skin types, typically oily in the T-zone and normal to dry on the
                cheeks and other areas. It requires a tailored approach to care, with products that balance oil control
                while providing adequate hydration to drier areas. Gentle exfoliation and a balanced cleansing routine
                can help manage this dual skin type effectively.</p>

            <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
            <p>Sensitive skin is often prone to redness, itching, burning, or stinging, especially when exposed to harsh
                chemicals, weather changes, or stress. This skin type needs gentle products with minimal artificial
                fragrances, dyes, or alcohol. Look for skincare options formulated specifically for sensitive skin, and
                avoid harsh exfoliants or strong active ingredients unless recommended by a dermatologist.</p>
