        <h2>Understanding Teen Skin Types</h2>
        <p>Teen skin is unique and often undergoes significant changes due to hormonal shifts during puberty.
            Identifying your skin type can help you develop a skincare routine that works best for your needs,
            preventing common skin issues and promoting healthy skin.</p>

        <h3>Normal Skin</h3>
        <p>Normal skin in teens is well-balanced with a smooth texture, minimal shine, and few imperfections. It
            typically has a clear appearance with a balanced level of moisture. Even though it is considered the
            ideal skin type, it is still essential to cleanse and moisturize regularly to maintain its health.</p>

        <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
        <p>Oily skin is one of the most common skin types among teenagers due to increased sebum production from
            hormonal changes. It is characterized by a shiny complexion, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose,
            and chin), and can be prone to acne and blackheads. To manage oily skin, teens should use oil-free or
            gel-based cleansers and non-comedogenic moisturizers. Regular exfoliation can also help prevent clogged
            pores and breakouts.</p>

        <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
        <p>Dry skin can make the face feel tight, flaky, or rough and may appear dull. It can be caused by
            environmental factors or a lack of moisture. Teens with dry skin should use hydrating products such as
            moisturizers with ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides to restore moisture and
            improve skin texture.</p>

        <h3>Combination Skin</h3>
        <p>Combination skin is common among teens and features an oily T-zone while other areas, such as the cheeks,
            may be normal or dry. This skin type requires a balanced approach to skincare to control excess oil
            while nourishing drier areas. Using gentle cleansers and targeted moisturizers can help manage
            combination skin effectively.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
        <p>Sensitive skin can react to various products or environmental conditions, leading to redness, itching, or
            irritation. Itâ€™s essential for teens with sensitive skin to choose fragrance-free and hypoallergenic
            products to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. A simple, gentle skincare routine with non-irritating
            ingredients is key to managing sensitive skin.</p>

        <p>Knowing your skin type can help you make the best choices for your skincare products and routines,
            ensuring a healthy and glowing complexion throughout your teenage years and beyond. Always remember to
            stay hydrated, cleanse your face regularly, and protect your skin with sunscreen.</p>
