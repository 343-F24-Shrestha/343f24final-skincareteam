    <ol>This is the url to our GitHub repo which is shared with each other and the professor:
        https://github.com/343-F24-Shrestha/343f24final-skincareteam</ol>
    <ol>This is the url to our deployed application where anyone could try our app:
        https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-skincareteam/</ol>
    <ol>We are including a page called report.html with an ordered list (Obviously, this document)</ol>
    <ol>We are using two media queries to support distinct layouts for medium and small screens in styles.css. There are
        comments describing this.</ol>
    <ol>Our site contains five separate pages: the main page, the quiz page, the teens page, the adults page, and the
        results page. The main page is used to encourage the user to take the quiz. The quiz page is for the user to
        fill out a form about their skin type. The results page gives results about the quiz and will include links to
        recommended products on Amazon. The teens page gives information about teenage skin. The adults page gives
        information about adult skin.</ol>
    <ol>We are using headers on each of the pages</ol>
    <ol>We are using a nav bar on each of our pages with several navigation links to navigate the website.</ol>
    <ol>There are images on the main page, and they all have descriptive alt attributes.</ol>
    <ol>Each page and stylesheet passes HTML validation.</ol>
    <ol>We are using Georgia font and Didact Gothic font, with serif and sans-serif as backups.</ol>
    <ol>We are using a form for our quiz page. The user will input their name. We are using JavaScript for content
        verification.</ol>
    <ol>We are using external links on our teens and adults page.</ol>
    <ol>We used ASIN API to link Amazon products on the results page. We also used Rapid API to list dermatology facts
        on the teens and adults pages.</ol>
